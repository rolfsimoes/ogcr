## Abstract

The OGCR API Specification defines a registry framework for carbon removal certification based on open geospatial standards and verifiable ledger integration. It specifies canonical data formats, lifecycle states, API interfaces, and blockchain anchoring methods for managing project design, monitoring, verification, and issuance of removal attestations. The specification builds upon GeoJSON \[1], JSON Schema \[2], and ERC-721 \[3] to support traceable, interoperable, and auditable carbon removal systems consistent with the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) and Regulation (EU) 2024/3012 \[4].

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This specification defines the functional and structural requirements for carbon removal registry systems. It establishes data formats, interface protocols, and lifecycle rules for managing project registration, monitoring, verification, and credit issuance. The framework is designed for interoperability with third-party systems, integration with public blockchains, and alignment with regulatory instruments such as the EU Carbon Removal Certification Regulation.

The scope includes data structures for project design documents (PDD), monitoring and verification reports (MRV), and certified removal units (CRU); conformance rules for state transitions; and patterns for cryptographic anchoring. Support is provided for multiple removal types, including land-based and industrial processes.

### 1.2 Design Principles

The specification is governed by five principles:

* **Minimality**: All data requirements SHALL support traceability, validation, and regulatory reporting, with no redundant fields.
* **Extensibility**: The data model and API structure SHALL accommodate evolving methodologies and domain-specific extensions.
* **Transparency**: All state changes SHALL be traceable, verifiable, and publicly inspectable.
* **Interoperability**: The specification SHALL conform to open standards to ensure compatibility with geospatial, registry, and blockchain systems.
* **Security**: Registry operations SHALL implement role-based access control and ensure cryptographic integrity of attestations.

### 1.3 Regulatory Context

This specification is intended to support implementation of Article 9 and Annexes I–III of Regulation (EU) 2024/3012 \[4]. It addresses certification requirements for permanent carbon removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage in products. It specifies data fields and workflows necessary for compliance with monitoring, verification, additionality, permanence, and liability provisions. The architecture supports registry interoperability, auditability, and integration with national and international carbon accounting mechanisms.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Overview

A registry system conforming to this specification SHALL implement a three-layer architecture that separates interface logic, application state management, and verifiable state anchoring. Each layer SHALL be functionally distinct and interoperable with external systems and services.

![System Architecture](../diagrams/system-architecture-component.png)

*Figure 1: Reference system architecture defining application, API, and ledger layers.*

The **Application Layer** provides interfaces for human and machine actors. This includes web portals, mobile clients, and automated integrations. It SHALL support user interaction, identity delegation, and task coordination.

The **API Layer** exposes a RESTful interface for lifecycle operations on registry artifacts. It SHALL implement validation, access control, schema enforcement, and canonical serialization. It MAY coordinate with external services for verification or monitoring.

The **Blockchain Layer** maintains immutable references to registry state. It SHALL record document hashes, lifecycle events, and token-related actions. Ledger anchoring MUST be cryptographically verifiable and support independent audit.

### 2.2 Data Flow

A conforming implementation SHALL support structured data flows for project registration, monitoring, verification, and issuance. Each transition SHALL be deterministic, auditable, and linked to a canonical document reference.

**Project Registration** begins with the submission of a Project Design Document (PDD). The API layer SHALL validate schema conformance, methodology references, and geospatial footprint. Upon approval, a unique identifier SHALL be assigned and the document hash anchored on-chain.

**Monitoring and Verification** involves the submission of Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) documents. These SHALL include quantified removals, methodology-specific inputs, and verifier attestations. Verified reports SHALL be linked to prior PDDs and recorded for audit and credit issuance.

**Credit Management** includes the creation, transfer, and retirement of carbon removal attestations. These SHALL be represented as cryptographically bound units (e.g., tokens), linked to verified removals and anchored for lifecycle traceability.

### 2.3 Integration Patterns

The specification defines standard integration patterns for registry federation, blockchain abstraction, and third-party system interoperability.

**Registry Federation** enables interoperability between multiple registry implementations. Federated systems SHALL prevent double counting, preserve provenance, and maintain cross-jurisdictional coherence.

**Blockchain Integration** SHALL support verifiable anchoring of document state and token issuance. The specification defines minimum on-chain data requirements, while allowing optimizations for gas efficiency, throughput, and chain-agnostic deployments.

**External System Integration** MAY include data providers, verifiers, or market actors. All integrations SHALL conform to standardized data schemas and authenticated communication protocols to ensure consistency and integrity.

## 3. Core Data Models

![Core Data Models](../diagrams/core-data-models-class.png)
*Figure 4: UML class diagram of canonical document types and their relationships.*

This specification defines three canonical document types used to represent project declarations, monitoring results, and verified removal units. All core documents SHALL be serialized as GeoJSON Features \[1] and SHALL follow schema constraints defined in the corresponding conformance classes.

### 3.1 Project Design Document (PDD)

The Project Design Document (PDD) defines the initial parameters of a carbon removal project. It SHALL contain project geometry, activity classification, actor identifiers, and methodological references. The PDD establishes the scope against which monitoring, verification, and issuance processes are evaluated.

Each PDD SHALL conform to the GeoJSON Feature model and SHALL include a valid `geometry` field representing the project boundary in WGS84 coordinates. The `properties` object SHALL contain required fields including project name, type, actor ID, and methodology reference.

PDDs SHALL reference approved methodologies that define quantification rules, monitoring requirements, and validation conditions. The PDD MAY include versioning metadata to track document evolution. Once validated, PDDs SHALL be immutable and anchored via cryptographic hash for audit purposes.

### 3.2 Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)

The MRV document captures quantitative results from project monitoring and verification activities. Each MRV SHALL reference a single parent PDD and SHALL represent a defined monitoring period. Overlapping reporting periods for the same project SHALL be disallowed.

MRV documents SHALL include temporal coverage, methodology-specific inputs, calculated net removal values, and uncertainty estimates. Measurement types MAY include field observations, remote sensing outputs, or direct measurement instruments, subject to methodology compatibility.

Verification metadata SHALL be included for independently validated MRVs. This MAY contain verifier identity, accreditation ID, verification outcome, and date. Verified MRVs form the basis for issuance of removal attestations.

### 3.3 Carbon Removal Units (CRUs)

Carbon Removal Units (CRUs) represent attested net removals of CO₂ equivalent. Each CRU SHALL be linked to a validated MRV and a parent PDD, and SHALL correspond to a quantifiable and verifiable removal amount.

CRUs SHALL be uniquely identifiable and SHALL include metadata that binds them to the underlying monitoring and verification context. Implementations MAY use token-based representations such as ERC-721 for lifecycle tracking, transferability, and retirement.

CRUs MAY be issued in fractional quantities where permitted by the registry. Each unit SHALL retain a one-to-one mapping to its provenance data. Retired CRUs SHALL be excluded from transfer and SHALL be cryptographically flagged as withdrawn from circulation.

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 API Design Philosophy

The OGCR API defines a resource-oriented interface for managing registry artifacts and lifecycle operations. All endpoints SHALL conform to REST architectural constraints and SHALL operate over standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

The API SHALL expose resource collections for projects, monitoring reports, and removal units. Each resource type SHALL implement a consistent set of operations for creation, retrieval, update (where allowed), and archival.

Implementations SHALL require only the minimum data necessary for conformance with the document schema and lifecycle rules. Optional fields MAY be used for extended functionality, provided they do not conflict with required validation logic.

Error responses SHALL follow a uniform structure, including HTTP status codes, machine-readable error identifiers, and human-readable messages. Validation errors SHALL include field-level annotations and reason codes.

The API interface, including endpoints, parameters, request/response structures, and authentication flows, SHALL be documented in a machine-readable format (e.g., OpenAPI). The documentation SHALL include example requests and expected responses for each operation.

### 4.2 Core API Endpoints

The OGCR API defines a set of resource-oriented endpoints for managing the lifecycle of registry documents and issued carbon removal units. Each endpoint group corresponds to a distinct functional process: project registration, monitoring and verification, and credit issuance and retirement.

All endpoints SHALL implement authenticated access, schema validation, and consistent response structures.

#### 4.2.1 Project Management

Project endpoints manage the creation, retrieval, update, and status tracking of carbon removal projects. A project is represented by a Project Design Document (PDD) and is associated with a unique identifier.

* **`POST /projects`**
  Submits a new project to the registry. The request body SHALL conform to the canonical PDD schema. The system SHALL validate document structure, methodology reference, and spatial geometry. Upon acceptance, a unique project identifier SHALL be issued and the PDD SHALL enter the `submitted` state.

![Project Registration Workflow](../diagrams/project-registration-sequence.png)
*Figure 2: Project registration lifecycle, from submission to validation and anchoring.*

* **`GET /projects/{projectId}`**
  Retrieves the full project record, including document content, status, version history, and links to associated monitoring reports.

* **`PUT /projects/{projectId}`**
  Updates a project document prior to validation. After validation, modifications SHALL be restricted to permitted metadata fields (e.g., contact information). All changes SHALL be versioned and timestamped.

* **`GET /projects`**
  Returns a paginated list of project entries. Query parameters MAY include status, methodology, actor, bounding box, and creation or approval date ranges.

#### 4.2.2 Monitoring and Verification

Monitoring endpoints handle submission and retrieval of monitoring reports (MRVs). Verification endpoints manage the attestation process by authorized verifiers.

* **`POST /projects/{projectId}/monitoring`**
  Submits a monitoring report for the specified project. The report SHALL conform to the MRV schema and SHALL not overlap temporally with any existing MRV for the same project. The system SHALL validate schema conformance, reporting period boundaries, and methodology consistency.

![MRV Workflow](../diagrams/mrv-workflow-sequence.png)
*Figure 3: MRV submission, verification, and issuance process.*

* **`GET /projects/{projectId}/monitoring`**
  Returns monitoring reports associated with a project. Filtering options MAY include reporting period, verification status, or verifier identity.

* **`POST /projects/{projectId}/monitoring/{reportId}/verify`**
  Submits a verification decision. Only authorized verifiers MAY call this endpoint. The request SHALL include verification status, documented outcome, and the amount of verified removal in metric tonnes CO₂e. Upon acceptance, the system SHALL update the MRV status and trigger credit issuance logic.

#### 4.2.3 Credit Management

Credit endpoints manage the lifecycle of Carbon Removal Units (CRUs), from issuance through transfer and retirement. Each unit represents a verified quantity of net CO₂ removal.

* **`GET /credits`**
  Returns a list of issued CRUs. Query parameters MAY include project ID, issuance year, owner address, and retirement status.

* **`POST /credits/transfer`**
  Transfers one or more CRUs to a new account. The request MUST include identifiers for the units to be transferred and the recipient’s address. The system SHALL verify ownership, recipient eligibility, and transaction validity before completing the operation.

* **`POST /credits/{creditId}/retire`**
  Permanently retires a CRU. The request SHALL include the retirement reason and MAY include beneficiary or use-case metadata. Retired units SHALL become non-transferable and remain publicly traceable in the registry.
### 4.3 Authentication and Authorization

The OGCR API SHALL implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to registry operations. Access control MUST be enforced at the interface, resource, and operation levels.

* **OAuth 2.0**
  SHALL be supported for authenticating human users and web-based clients. Supported flows SHALL include authorization code and client credentials. Access tokens SHALL define scoped permissions, restricting access to specific endpoints and operations.

* **API Keys**
  MAY be issued for server-to-server integrations or automated agents. Each API key SHALL be bound to an organization and associated with defined scopes and rate limits. Keys SHALL be revocable.

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  SHALL be used to restrict operations based on assigned roles. Core roles include `developer`, `verifier`, `operator`, and `holder`. Each role SHALL be associated with a defined set of permissions. The system SHALL validate role-based permissions on all sensitive operations.

All access attempts and authorization decisions SHALL be logged. Audit logs SHALL record timestamps, actor identity, resource identifiers, and outcome status. Logs MUST be available for inspection by authorized administrators.

### 4.4 Data Validation and Quality Assurance

All submitted documents and requests to the API SHALL be subject to multi-level validation to ensure schema compliance, business rule conformity, and data quality.

* **Schema Validation**
  SHALL be applied to all resource submissions. Each core document type (PDD, MRV) SHALL be validated against its corresponding JSON Schema:

  * [PDD Schema](../schemas/pdd-schema.json)
  * [MRV Schema](../schemas/mrv-schema.json)

  Validation SHALL include type checking, required fields, format constraints, and enumerated values. Error responses MUST reference the failing field and SHALL include human-readable correction guidance.

* **Business Rule Validation**
  SHALL enforce constraints beyond schema structure, including:

  * Non-overlapping monitoring periods per project
  * Valid methodology reference and version
  * Non-intersecting project geometries
  * Role-based operation limits

  These rules MAY be adapted based on jurisdictional or methodological requirements and SHALL be documented.

* **Data Quality Assessment**
  MAY be applied to submitted documents. Quality indicators MAY include completeness, internal consistency, and adherence to reporting best practices. The registry MAY assign a non-normative quality score to each submission for reporting or review prioritization purposes.

Registries implementing this specification SHOULD support validation dashboards and issue tracking interfaces to enable continuous improvement in submission accuracy and consistency.

### 4.5 Performance and Scalability

The OGCR API SHALL support scalable operation under variable load conditions. Implementations SHALL include mechanisms for performance optimization, fault tolerance, and efficient access to large datasets.

* **Caching**
  Responses to frequently accessed resources MAY be cached at the server or proxy level. Cache invalidation mechanisms SHALL ensure consistency with underlying registry state. Time-to-live (TTL) policies and conditional request headers (e.g., `ETag`) MAY be used.

* **Pagination and Filtering**
  Collection endpoints SHALL support pagination. Offset-based pagination SHALL be supported by default; cursor-based pagination MAY be provided for large or real-time datasets. Query parameters for filtering and sorting by attributes (e.g., status, date, geography) SHALL be implemented to limit payload size and improve response performance.

* **Asynchronous Operations**
  Time-intensive processes such as schema validation, verification submission, and ledger anchoring MAY be handled asynchronously. The initiating endpoint SHALL return a task identifier, and a separate status endpoint SHALL provide progress updates and final outcomes.

* **Rate Limiting**
  The API SHALL enforce rate limits to manage resource usage. Limits MAY vary by role, client type, or endpoint category. When a rate limit is exceeded, the API SHALL return an HTTP 429 response with a `Retry-After` header.

Implementations SHOULD monitor system performance and provide administrative access to runtime metrics for operational oversight.

## 5. Smart Contract Requirements

### 5.1 Smart Contract Architecture

The OGCR Specification defines requirements for smart contracts that SHALL provide immutable state anchoring, verifiable state transitions, and support for decentralized governance. The architecture SHALL follow modular design principles and MUST emit event logs for all critical operations.

* **Modular Contract Design**
  Smart contract logic SHALL be separated into components with defined responsibilities. Each contract SHALL handle one core function: project registration, MRV anchoring, unit issuance, or access control. Contracts MAY be independently deployed and upgraded.

* **Upgradeability**
  Implementations MAY use proxy patterns to enable logic upgrades. Upgrade mechanisms SHOULD include governance constraints such as delay periods, multi-signature authorization, or stakeholder voting. State variables MUST remain consistent across upgrades.

* **Event Emission**
  All state-changing actions (e.g., registration, approval, issuance) MUST emit events. Events SHALL include sufficient metadata to support off-chain indexing, registry reconciliation, and external monitoring.

### 5.2 Core Contract Types

A conforming implementation SHALL deploy the following smart contract types. Each contract SHALL expose interfaces required for integration with the API and registry backend. Access to state-changing functions MUST be restricted to authorized roles.

#### 5.2.1 Project Registry Contract

The Project Registry Contract SHALL store immutable references to submitted project design documents and track project lifecycle status.

* **Registration**
  The contract SHALL accept project document hashes, unique identifiers, and metadata submitted by authorized actors. On success, the contract SHALL emit a `PDDRegistered` event.

* **Approval and Rejection**
  Validators MAY update project status by invoking approval or rejection functions. Each decision MUST be logged with a timestamp and validator address. Rejections MAY include justification metadata.

* **Status Transitions**
  Projects MAY transition through states including `draft`, `submitted`, `validated`, `rejected`, or `archived`. Each transition MUST be recorded via event emission.

![Project Lifecycle States](../diagrams/lifecycle-states.png)
*Figure 5: Valid state transitions for registered projects.*

Read access to project metadata and status MUST be publicly available. Write operations MUST be restricted to accounts with appropriate roles (e.g., `developer`, `validator`, `operator`).

#### 5.2.2 MRV Registry Contract

The MRV Registry Contract SHALL manage hashes and metadata for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) records. Each MRV record MUST reference an approved project and a specific reporting period.

* **Submission**
  Authorized actors MAY submit monitoring report hashes along with associated metadata. The contract SHALL validate that the referenced project is approved and that the reporting period does not overlap with existing entries.

* **Verification**
  Authorized verifiers MAY record verification outcomes, including net removal quantities and dates. The contract MUST emit a `MRVVerified` event containing the MRV ID, verifier address, and quantified amount.

* **Hash Integrity**
  The contract SHALL store cryptographic hashes of each MRV report. Off-chain systems MAY verify report integrity by comparing content hashes to on-chain references.

Temporal constraints MUST ensure that monitoring reports do not overlap and that all periods align with project timelines and methodology requirements.

#### 5.2.3 Carbon Credit Token Contract

The Carbon Credit Token Contract SHALL represent Carbon Removal Units (CRUs) as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) conforming to the ERC-721 standard \[3]. Each token MUST represent a verified quantity of carbon removal and MUST be traceable to its source MRV and project.

* **Minting**
  Only authorized actors MAY mint tokens. Each mint operation MUST reference a verified MRV, and the resulting token MUST include metadata fields for project ID, MRV ID, vintage year, and amount. A `CRUMinted` event MUST be emitted.

* **Transfer**
  Token holders MAY transfer tokens subject to registry rules. All transfers MUST be logged with timestamps and involved addresses. Optional restrictions MAY be applied based on regulatory constraints or credit type.

* **Retirement**
  Tokens MAY be retired to finalize a carbon offset claim. Retired tokens MUST be non-transferable and MUST retain all metadata for auditability. A `CRURetired` event MUST be emitted with a reason code.

Each token’s metadata structure SHALL include project identifiers, reporting period, carbon amount, issuance and retirement status, and any relevant compliance attributes.

#### 5.2.4 Access Control Contract

The Access Control Contract manages roles, permissions, and authorization across the entire smart contract system. This contract provides centralized access control while enabling role delegation and permission management.

**Role Management** functions enable administrators to assign and revoke roles for different types of registry participants. Roles include project developers, verifiers, registry operators, and system administrators with specific permissions for each role type.

**Permission Validation** functions provide authorization checking for all contract operations. Permission validation ensures that only authorized parties can perform specific operations while maintaining audit trails of access attempts.

**Multi-Signature Support** enables critical operations to require approval from multiple authorized parties. Multi-signature requirements provide additional security for sensitive operations such as contract upgrades and role assignments.

Emergency functions enable rapid response to security issues or system problems while maintaining appropriate governance controls and audit trails.

### 5.3 Integration Requirements

Smart contracts must integrate seamlessly with off-chain registry systems while maintaining data consistency and security. Integration requirements define interfaces, data formats, and synchronization mechanisms that enable reliable operation.

**Event Monitoring** systems must monitor contract events in real-time to maintain synchronization between blockchain and registry systems. Event processing includes validation, error handling, and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data synchronization.

**State Synchronization** mechanisms ensure that off-chain systems accurately reflect on-chain state while handling network issues, reorganizations, and other blockchain-specific challenges.

**Gas Optimization** strategies minimize transaction costs while maintaining functionality and security. Optimization includes batch operations, efficient data structures, and careful function design to reduce computational requirements.

**Network Compatibility** ensures that contracts can operate on multiple blockchain networks with appropriate modifications for network-specific features and limitations.

### 5.4 Security Requirements

Smart contract security is paramount given the immutable nature of blockchain systems and the value of carbon credits. Security requirements address common vulnerabilities while providing defense-in-depth protection.

**Access Control Validation** ensures that all functions properly validate caller permissions before executing operations. Access control includes role-based permissions, multi-signature requirements, and emergency controls.

**Input Validation** prevents malicious or malformed inputs from causing contract failures or security vulnerabilities. Validation includes parameter checking, overflow protection, and state consistency verification.

**Reentrancy Protection** prevents reentrancy attacks through appropriate function modifiers and state management. Protection mechanisms include checks-effects-interactions patterns and reentrancy guards.

**Upgrade Security** ensures that contract upgrades maintain security properties while enabling necessary improvements. Upgrade mechanisms include time delays, governance requirements, and migration procedures.

**Audit Requirements** mandate comprehensive security audits before contract deployment and after significant upgrades. Audit processes include automated testing, manual review, and formal verification where appropriate.

## 6. Extensibility Framework

### 6.1 Methodology Extension System

The Carbon Registry Specification provides a comprehensive framework for extending the system to support new carbon removal methodologies without requiring core system modifications. This extensibility ensures that the registry can adapt to emerging technologies and evolving scientific understanding while maintaining consistency and interoperability.

**Methodology Registration** enables the addition of new methodologies through a standardized process that includes methodology documentation, validation rules, and monitoring requirements. Registered methodologies receive unique identifiers and version numbers that enable precise referencing and evolution tracking.

**Schema Extension** allows methodologies to define additional data fields and validation rules that extend the core project and monitoring data models. Extensions are implemented through JSON Schema composition that maintains backward compatibility while enabling methodology-specific requirements.

**Validation Plugin Architecture** enables methodologies to implement custom validation logic that enforces methodology-specific requirements. Validation plugins operate within sandboxed environments that prevent interference with core system operations while enabling sophisticated validation capabilities.

**Calculation Engine Integration** provides interfaces for methodology-specific calculation engines that quantify carbon removal amounts based on monitoring data. Calculation engines operate as independent services that receive standardized inputs and produce standardized outputs with uncertainty estimates.

### 6.2 Integration Extension Points

The specification defines multiple extension points that enable integration with external systems, services, and data sources without modifying core registry functionality. These extension points provide flexibility while maintaining system security and data integrity.

**Data Source Connectors** enable integration with external monitoring systems, satellite data providers, and IoT sensor networks. Connectors implement standardized interfaces that handle authentication, data retrieval, and format conversion while maintaining data provenance and quality tracking.

**Verification Service Integration** allows the system to work with different verification bodies and automated verification systems. Integration includes credential verification, workflow management, and result recording while maintaining independence and avoiding conflicts of interest.

**Market Platform Integration** enables connectivity with carbon credit trading platforms, offset marketplaces, and registry federation systems. Integration maintains credit authenticity and prevents double-counting while enabling market liquidity and price discovery.

**Regulatory Reporting Integration** provides interfaces for automated reporting to regulatory bodies and compliance systems. Reporting integration includes data formatting, submission scheduling, and confirmation tracking while maintaining data privacy and security.

### 6.3 Governance Extension Framework

The specification includes governance mechanisms that enable stakeholder participation in system evolution while maintaining stability and security. Governance extensions provide transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.

**Proposal System** enables stakeholders to propose system improvements, methodology additions, and policy changes through structured processes. Proposals include impact assessments, implementation plans, and stakeholder consultation requirements.

**Voting Mechanisms** provide transparent decision-making processes for governance proposals with appropriate weighting for different stakeholder types. Voting systems include quorum requirements, time limits, and result implementation procedures.

**Advisory Committee Integration** enables the formation of technical and policy advisory committees that provide expertise and guidance for system development. Committee integration includes member selection, meeting management, and recommendation tracking.

**Audit and Compliance Framework** provides mechanisms for independent auditing of system operations, methodology implementations, and governance decisions. Audit frameworks include scope definition, auditor selection, and result publication requirements.

### 6.4 Technical Extension Architecture

The technical architecture provides multiple layers of extensibility that enable customization and enhancement without compromising system integrity or performance. Technical extensions operate within defined boundaries that maintain security and compatibility.

**Plugin Architecture** enables the addition of new functionality through standardized plugin interfaces. Plugins operate in isolated environments with defined resource limits and communication channels that prevent interference with core operations.

**API Extension Framework** allows the addition of new API endpoints and functionality while maintaining consistency with existing interfaces. API extensions include authentication integration, rate limiting, and documentation requirements.

**Database Extension Schema** provides mechanisms for adding new data types and relationships while maintaining referential integrity and performance. Schema extensions include migration procedures, indexing requirements, and backup considerations.

**Monitoring and Alerting Extensions** enable the addition of custom monitoring metrics, alerting rules, and dashboard components. Monitoring extensions integrate with existing observability infrastructure while providing methodology-specific insights and alerts.

The extensibility framework ensures that the Carbon Registry Specification can evolve to meet changing requirements while maintaining the core principles of minimalism, transparency, and interoperability that define the system architecture.
