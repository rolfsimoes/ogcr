## Abstract

The OGCR API Specification defines a comprehensive framework for managing carbon removal projects through a hybrid architecture that combines off-chain registry operations with on-chain verification and tokenization. This specification establishes standardized data formats, API interfaces, and blockchain integration patterns that enable transparent, verifiable, and interoperable carbon removal registries.

The specification builds upon established standards including GeoJSON [1], JSON Schema [2], and ERC-721 [3] to create an interoperable system that supports the full lifecycle of carbon removal projects from initial design through monitoring, verification, and credit issuance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Carbon Registry Specification addresses the critical need for standardized, transparent, and verifiable carbon removal project management. As global climate commitments intensify and carbon markets mature, the demand for robust registry systems that can handle complex project lifecycles while maintaining data integrity has become paramount.

This specification defines a modular architecture that separates concerns between business logic, data management, and blockchain verification. The system supports multiple project types including afforestation, soil carbon sequestration, direct air capture, and enhanced weathering, while providing extensibility for emerging methodologies.

The scope encompasses project registration, monitoring and verification workflows, credit issuance and management, and integration with blockchain networks for immutable record-keeping. The specification prioritizes minimal data requirements to reduce barriers to entry while ensuring sufficient information for verification and compliance.

### 1.2 Design Principles

The Carbon Registry Specification is built on five core principles that guide all architectural decisions and implementation requirements.

**Minimalism and Usability** form the foundation of the specification. The system requires only essential information for project registration and operation, reducing administrative burden while maintaining verification integrity. User interfaces and API endpoints are designed for intuitive operation by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Extensibility and Future-Proofing** ensure the specification can adapt to evolving methodologies, regulatory requirements, and technological advances. The modular architecture allows for new project types, verification methods, and integration patterns without requiring fundamental system changes.

**Transparency and Auditability** are achieved through comprehensive event logging, immutable record-keeping, and public access to verification data. All system actions are traceable, and stakeholders can independently verify project claims and credit authenticity.

**Interoperability and Standards Compliance** enable integration with existing carbon market infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and blockchain networks. The specification builds upon established standards and provides clear migration paths from legacy systems.

**Security and Trust** are maintained through cryptographic verification, role-based access controls, and separation of sensitive operations. The hybrid architecture ensures that critical data remains secure while enabling necessary transparency.

### 1.3 Regulatory Context

The specification aligns with emerging regulatory frameworks including the EU Carbon Removal Certification Regulation (EU) 2024/3012 [4], which establishes requirements for permanent carbon removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage verification. The regulation emphasizes the need for robust monitoring, reporting, and verification systems that can demonstrate additionality, permanence, and environmental integrity.

Key regulatory requirements addressed by this specification include mandatory monitoring protocols, third-party verification, transparent reporting, and integration with national and international carbon accounting systems. The specification provides flexibility to accommodate varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions while maintaining core interoperability.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Overview

The Carbon Registry Specification employs a three-layer hybrid architecture that balances scalability, security, and transparency requirements. This design separates business logic from data storage and verification, enabling independent scaling and optimization of each component.

![System Architecture](../diagrams/system-architecture-component.png)

*Figure 1: OGCR API System Architecture - The three-layer hybrid architecture showing the separation between API layer, business logic, and blockchain verification components.*

The **Application Layer** encompasses user interfaces, mobile applications, and third-party integrations that interact with the registry system. This layer handles user authentication, data presentation, and workflow management while abstracting the complexity of underlying systems.

The **API Layer** provides RESTful interfaces for all registry operations including project registration, monitoring data submission, verification workflows, and credit management. This layer implements business logic, data validation, access controls, and integration with external systems.

The **Blockchain Layer** maintains immutable records of critical system events, document hashes, and token operations. This layer provides cryptographic proof of data integrity, enables trustless verification, and supports decentralized governance mechanisms.

### 2.2 Data Flow Architecture

Data flows through the system following clearly defined patterns that ensure consistency, auditability, and performance. Project data originates from developers and flows through validation, verification, and approval processes before reaching the blockchain layer for immutable storage.

**Project Registration Flow** begins with developers submitting Project Design Documents (PDDs) through the API layer. The system validates document structure, methodology compliance, and spatial requirements before generating cryptographic hashes and storing references on-chain. Approved projects receive unique identifiers that link all subsequent activities.

**Monitoring and Verification Flow** processes periodic monitoring reports that quantify carbon removal activities. Submitted data undergoes automated validation followed by third-party verification. Verified results trigger credit issuance processes and update project status records.

**Credit Management Flow** handles the creation, transfer, and retirement of carbon credits based on verified monitoring results. Credits are represented as blockchain tokens with metadata linking to underlying project data and verification reports.

### 2.3 Integration Patterns

The specification defines standard integration patterns that enable interoperability with existing carbon market infrastructure, regulatory systems, and blockchain networks. These patterns provide flexibility while maintaining data consistency and security.

**Registry Federation** allows multiple registry instances to share data and recognize credits issued by partner systems. Federation protocols ensure that credits cannot be double-counted while enabling market liquidity and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions.

**Blockchain Integration** supports multiple blockchain networks through standardized smart contract interfaces. The specification defines minimum requirements for on-chain data while allowing implementation-specific optimizations for gas efficiency and throughput.

**External System Integration** provides APIs for connecting with monitoring equipment, satellite data providers, verification bodies, and carbon market platforms. Standard data formats and authentication mechanisms ensure secure and reliable data exchange.

## 3. Core Data Models

![Core Data Models](../diagrams/core-data-models-class.png)

*Figure 4: Core Data Models - UML class diagram showing the relationships between Project Design Documents, MRV Documents, Carbon Credits, and supporting entities.*

### 3.1 Project Design Document (PDD)

The Project Design Document serves as the foundational record for all carbon removal projects within the registry system. The PDD captures essential project information in a structured format that supports validation, monitoring, and verification activities throughout the project lifecycle.

The PDD extends the GeoJSON Feature specification [1] to provide spatial context while maintaining compatibility with existing geographic information systems. This approach enables spatial analysis, boundary verification, and integration with satellite monitoring systems.

Core PDD fields include project identification, geographic boundaries, methodology references, baseline scenarios, and expected outcomes. The specification requires minimal information to reduce barriers to entry while ensuring sufficient detail for verification and monitoring activities.

**Spatial Requirements** mandate that all projects include precise geographic boundaries using WGS84 coordinates. Boundary data supports spatial analysis, overlap detection, and integration with remote sensing systems for monitoring verification.

**Methodology Integration** requires projects to reference approved methodologies that define calculation procedures, monitoring requirements, and verification protocols. This approach ensures consistency while enabling innovation in carbon removal techniques.

**Versioning and Immutability** mechanisms track changes to project documents while maintaining historical records. Once submitted for verification, PDDs become immutable to ensure audit trail integrity.

### 3.2 Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)

The MRV data model captures periodic monitoring results that quantify carbon removal activities and demonstrate compliance with methodology requirements. MRV documents link to parent PDDs and provide the basis for credit issuance decisions.

**Temporal Structure** organizes monitoring data by reporting periods that align with methodology requirements and regulatory frameworks. Each MRV document covers a specific time period and cannot overlap with other reports for the same project.

**Measurement Data** includes quantitative results from monitoring activities such as biomass measurements, soil carbon analysis, or direct air capture volumes. The specification accommodates various measurement types while requiring standardized units and uncertainty estimates.

**Verification Records** document third-party verification activities including verifier credentials, verification procedures, and outcome determinations. Verification records provide the basis for credit issuance and regulatory compliance.

### 3.3 Carbon Removal Units (CRUs)

Carbon Removal Units represent verified carbon removal quantities that can be traded, transferred, or retired for offsetting purposes. CRUs are implemented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that provide unique identification and traceability.

**Token Metadata** links each CRU to its originating project, monitoring period, and verification records. This metadata enables full traceability from credit to underlying carbon removal activity.

**Lifecycle Management** tracks CRU status through creation, transfer, and retirement phases. Retired CRUs cannot be transferred or traded, ensuring that offset claims are permanent and verifiable.

**Fractional Representation** allows large carbon removal quantities to be divided into smaller, tradeable units while maintaining traceability to source activities. This approach enhances market liquidity while preserving verification integrity.
