**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Date:** July 2025   
**Authors:** OGCR Consortium  
**Status:** Draft  
**License:** CC-BY 4.0

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive requirements for smart contracts that support the OGCR API Specification. The smart contract system provides immutable record-keeping, transparent governance, and trustless verification capabilities for carbon removal projects, monitoring reports, and credit management.

The specification defines four core contract types that work together to create a complete blockchain-based registry system while maintaining separation of concerns and enabling independent upgrades and optimizations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The smart contract requirements establish the foundation for blockchain integration within the Carbon Registry ecosystem. These contracts serve as the immutable backbone that ensures transparency, prevents double-counting, and enables trustless verification of carbon removal activities.

The scope encompasses project registration, monitoring report verification, carbon credit tokenization, and comprehensive access control mechanisms. The contracts are designed to operate on multiple blockchain networks while maintaining consistent functionality and security properties.

### 1.2 Design Principles

**Immutability and Transparency** form the core foundation of the smart contract architecture. All critical project data, state transitions, and verification outcomes are recorded permanently on the blockchain with complete transparency for public verification and audit purposes.

**Modularity and Upgradeability** ensure that the contract system can evolve with changing requirements while preserving existing data and maintaining user trust. The modular design allows independent upgrades of specific functionality without affecting the entire system.

**Gas Efficiency and Scalability** optimize transaction costs while maintaining full functionality. The contracts minimize on-chain storage requirements and implement batch operations where appropriate to reduce operational costs for users.

**Security and Access Control** implement comprehensive security measures including role-based permissions, multi-signature requirements for critical operations, and protection against common smart contract vulnerabilities.

**Interoperability and Standards Compliance** ensure compatibility with existing blockchain infrastructure, token standards, and integration patterns. The contracts follow established standards while adding carbon-specific functionality.

### 1.3 Regulatory Compliance

The smart contract requirements address regulatory compliance needs including audit trails, data retention, and integration with national and international carbon accounting systems. The contracts provide the necessary transparency and immutability to support regulatory reporting while maintaining appropriate privacy protections.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Contract Hierarchy

The smart contract system consists of four primary contracts that interact through well-defined interfaces while maintaining clear separation of responsibilities.

**ProjectRegistry Contract** manages the registration, approval, and lifecycle of carbon removal projects. This contract serves as the authoritative source for project status and provides the foundation for all subsequent activities.

**MRVRegistry Contract** handles monitoring, reporting, and verification records for approved projects. This contract links monitoring reports to projects while tracking verification status and quantified carbon removal amounts.

**CRUToken Contract** implements carbon removal units as non-fungible tokens that provide unique identification, ownership tracking, and transfer capabilities. This contract follows ERC-721 standards while adding carbon-specific functionality.

**AccessControl Contract** manages roles, permissions, and authorization across the entire smart contract system. This contract provides centralized access control while enabling role delegation and permission management.

### 2.2 Data Flow Architecture

Data flows through the contract system following clearly defined patterns that ensure consistency, security, and auditability. Each contract validates inputs, updates state, and emits events that enable off-chain synchronization and monitoring.

**Project Registration Flow** begins with project developers submitting project document hashes to the ProjectRegistry contract. The contract validates caller permissions, stores project metadata, and emits registration events that trigger off-chain processing.

**Approval Workflow** enables authorized validators to approve registered projects through the ProjectRegistry contract. Approval decisions are recorded with validator identities and supporting documentation references.

**MRV Processing Flow** allows authorized verifiers to record verified monitoring results through the MRVRegistry contract. Verified results trigger credit issuance processes and update project status records.

**Credit Management Flow** handles the creation, transfer, and retirement of carbon credits through the CRUToken contract. All credit operations are logged with complete audit trails and ownership tracking.

### 2.3 Event Architecture

The contract system implements comprehensive event logging that enables real-time monitoring, off-chain synchronization, and audit trail maintenance. Events provide the primary mechanism for communication between blockchain and off-chain systems.

**Indexed Events** enable efficient filtering and querying of blockchain data by project identifiers, user addresses, and other key parameters. Proper indexing ensures that off-chain systems can efficiently monitor relevant events.

**Event Payload Design** balances information completeness with gas efficiency by including essential data in events while referencing additional details through document hashes and external storage systems.

**Event Ordering and Consistency** mechanisms ensure that events are processed in the correct order and that off-chain systems can maintain consistent state even in the presence of blockchain reorganizations.
